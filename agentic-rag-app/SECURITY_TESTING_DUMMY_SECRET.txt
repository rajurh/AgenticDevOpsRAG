### DUMMY SECRET FOR SECRET-SCANNING TESTS
# This file intentionally contains a harmless dummy token so that secret-scanning
# workflows can be tested. DO NOT include real secrets in this file.

# NOTE: This is intentionally a clearly fake provider-like token that includes
# the word "DUMMY" so it cannot be mistaken for a real secret. It is used
# only to test secret-scanning workflows (GHAS / gitleaks). Remove after testing.

# Example GitHub Personal Access Token-like dummy (prefixed with ghp_)
# The string is fake and contains 'DUMMY' — DO NOT USE THIS VALUE.
